    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 29, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Saints App ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information. By using the Saints App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
    <div class="highlight">
        <span class="pledge-title">Our Opt-In Pledge</span>
        <p>Your trust is sacred. We guarantee that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Data Collection will always be Opt-In:</strong> If we ever introduce features that require data (like cloud backups), you will be asked for explicit permission first. We will never collect data silently in the background.</li>
            <li><strong>No "Paywalling" with Privacy:</strong> The core features of the app—praying, reading scripture, and tracking your daily streak—will <strong>always</strong> be available without the need for an account or data collection.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>Current Practices:</strong> The Saints App operates as a "local-first" application. Your preferences, prayer streaks, favorites, and settings are stored entirely on your device.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> We may eventually add features to improve your experience (such as syncing streaks across devices). If we do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You will have the choice to enable or ignore these features.</li>
        <li>If you choose not to opt-in, the app will continue to function in "Offline Mode" using only local storage.</li>
        <li>We will never sell your personal data to third parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app contains links to external sites (such as Etsy). These links are contextual (based on the Saint you are viewing) and do not use personal tracking data. If you click a link, you will be directed to that site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external sites.</p>

    <h2>3. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>5. Scripture Attribution</h2>
    <p>Scripture quotations are taken from the World English Bible (WEB), which is in the public domain. For more information: https://ebible.org/</p>
